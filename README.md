# Muqrakr
## Muqrakr campaign finance project

Muqrakr is a political campaign finance search tool. It uses the ProPublica Campaign Finance API to retrieve financial info for political candidates and political campaign committees. It can even retrieve data on lobbyist contributions.

A user can create a profile and save searches to their profile which can be downloaded to a CSV for further data analysis.

## Why make this site?
I wanted to allow people to have a very simple search tool for looking up campaign finance information on their elected officials. Transparency and accountability will make for better government and that starts with following the money.

## Next steps
As you can probably see, Muqrakr is currently down. I hope to redeploy it to something like Heroku, Netlify etc... so that it can start helping people follow the money - something that becomes of increasing importance in each successive election year. After redeploying the site, I want to refactor the javascript code, move the database to something more production ready like PostgreSQL, improve the user signup form, and build out the user profile section. If you go to the 'Projects' tab you can see my product roadmap of planned fixes and features.
